Baldwin Family Conduct Statement

As Baldwins, we do not jump people, gang up on others, or initiate violence.

We do not expect others to jump in for us either — we handle ourselves with personal responsibility and discipline.

If one of us is attacked, it is viewed as an unfortunate situation, not a call to escalate or start a cycle of retaliation.

We believe in letting consequences unfold naturally (“what comes around goes around”) without taking justice into our own hands.

As founder, Shane E. Baldwin does not speak for or control the choices of younger siblings or half-siblings.

Past incidents where Shane was attacked did not result in retaliation or family violence, and this continues to set the standard:
the Baldwin way is strength, restraint, and self-control — not revenge.

We follow the principle taught by our father:
Stand strong, stay disciplined, and avoid unnecessary fights or feuds.
