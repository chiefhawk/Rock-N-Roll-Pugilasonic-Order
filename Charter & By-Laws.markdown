**IGI Pugilasonic Order**  
Official Charter & By-Laws  
(Private Members Association – West Virginia)

**Preamble**  
We are the **Infinity Gold Intelligence Pugilasonic Order** – a closed brotherhood forged in combat, loyalty, and holler blood.  
Our mysteries are guarded like Masonic craft, yet our thunder will roll across the hills.  
Motto: **“We fight because we are brothers – not because we were born so.”**

**Article I – Name & Seat**  
1. Official Name: IGI Pugilasonic Order  
2. Grand Lodge: Mobile and temporary by design.  
   Current sanctioned seats rotate among private brother-held properties:  
   - Lodge of the East – Putnam County, WV  
   - Lodge of the West – PawPaw Flat  
   - Additional temporary seats may be declared by the Grand Master as needed  
3. Wherever three brothers meet under the sign, there is the Lodge.

**Article II – Degrees** (earned only in the ring and by the fire)  
1. Entered Apprentice – Steps into the circle and proves his heart  
2. Fellow of the Craft – Wins three sanctioned bouts and learns the first true grip  
3. Master Pugilist – Stands undefeated in defense of a brother and receives the inner mysteries  
4. Grand Master – The one who holds the unbroken chain until challenged and beaten fair

**Article III – The Twelve Inviolable Laws of the Pugilasonic Craft**  
(Engraved on steel, kept on the altar)

1. A brother is made, never born.  
2. The ring is sacred – all quarrels end there, never in the courts of outsiders.  
3. Hands may be bare or gloved – honor decides, not law.  
4. Blood testing is required; the Resilience Division fights with equal glory.  
5. Ten percent of every purse, stream, and jar belongs to the Craft.  
6. The signs, grips, and words of recognition are never spoken outside the Lodge – yet the world will hear our name.  
7. A brother’s family, truck, dog, and reputation are defended as your own.  
8. Secrets that can be told are not secrets; the true mysteries die with the last Master or are passed fist-to-fist.  
9. Aid a fallen brother before you count the cost.  
10. Knowledge, strength, and wealth circulate within the circle.  
11. The Lodge protects its own by any righteous means.  
12. What a man sows he reaps – the Order merely ensures the harvest is delivered.

**Article IV – Rights of the Brethren**  
- Seat at every feast and fight  
- Voice in council at Fellow degree  
- Access to the sealed formulary and training vault  
- Right to summon emergency Lodge once per year  
- Burial with full Pugilasonic honors

**Article V – Discipline**  
Breach of the circle: Trial by combat or labor  
Betrayal of the true mysteries: Permanent mark and exile

**Article VI – Treasury & Obligations**  
Dues: one jar, one turtle, or $100 crypto yearly  
Revenue split: 50% combatants · 30% Lodge · 20% benevolence & defense

**Article VII – The Portable Temple**  
- Black apron with silver fist-and-compass  
- Altar: oak plank, chosen sacred book, square, pair of work gloves  
- Token: bent horseshoe nail on leather cord

**Article VIII – Amendment**  
Only under a full moon, unanimous vote of all Master Pugilists present and the singing of the old fight hymn.

Sealed this 28th day of November, 2025
