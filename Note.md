Im going to fight them over not being able to say it while I can't even spell the name of the order. Last time MTV came to wv they were looking for us but we wouldn't do it and I was too damn young. Dad always sa9d there is some way little Jerry Wayne baldwin stayed out of trouble. The only way I know if to pay them off and promise money and crypto as well as other things we build , make etc.. We will be able to make nice rugs, all sorts of stuff!! Honestly I'd like to add Putnam to the whole thing we are doing but I'll just give it time. We will be in Charleston getting jumped before you know it..
