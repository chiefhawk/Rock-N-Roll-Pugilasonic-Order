**IGI PUGILASONIC ORDER**  
Universal Charter & By-Laws  
(Private Members Association – Worldwide)

**Article I – Name & Jurisdiction**  
1. Official Name: IGI Pugilasonic Order  
2. Jurisdiction: Worldwide  
3. Grand Lodge: Mobile and perpetual. Wherever three brothers raise the altar, the Lodge exists.

**Article II – Degrees & Ranks** (earned only through real combat and loyalty)  
1. Entered Apprentice  
2. Fellow of the Craft  
3. Master Pugilist  
4. **Sergeant-at-Arms** – Appointed officer rank. Enforces Order law, conducts gear/drug checks, and stands as first line of defense for the brotherhood.  
5. Grand Master – Holder of the chain until fairly defeated

**Article III – The Fourteen Eternal Laws of the Pugilasonic Craft**  
(Engraved on steel, carried in every Lodge kit)

1. A brother is made in the ring, never born in a cradle.  
2. All quarrels end in the circle – never in outside courts.  
3. Bare knuckles or gloved – honor chooses.  
4. Mandatory blood/testing panel before every sanctioned event.  
5. **GI-Rocks (Golden-Age Energy Formula)** is the sole sanctioned performance compound of the Order. Possession and use is a privilege reserved for active, training members in good standing.  
6. GI-Rocks may only be distributed by a Master Pugilist or Sergeant-at-Arms after verification of clean health, consistent training, and no visible signs of hard-drug abuse (sores, track marks, etc.).  
7. Any member or guest found in possession of methamphetamine, fentanyl, heroin, crack, or any Schedule I/II substance other than GI-Rocks will be immediately detained by the Sergeant-at-Arms, the substance secured, and local law enforcement called to take custody and dispose of it properly.  
8. The member/guest will then face Order discipline (suspension or exile) – because we protect the Craft, not the poison.  
9. Ten percent of every purse, stream, and jar belongs to the Order.  
10. The true signs, grips, and words are never written nor spoken outside closed Lodge.  
11. A brother’s family, property, and name are sacred – defend them without hesitation.  
12. What begins staged becomes real as the brotherhood perfects itself.  
13. Aid a fallen brother before counting cost.  
14. What a man sows, he reaps – the Pugilasonic ensures delivery by righteous means.

**Article IV – GI-Rocks Protocol (Official Order Supplement)**  
- Formula remains sealed; only Masters and Sergeants-at-Arms may compound or distribute.  
- Use limited to members who train minimum 4 days/week and pass quarterly health checks.  
- Violation of GI-Rocks privilege = 90-day suspension from the circle.

**Article V – Rights, Treasury, Temple, etc.**  
(Remain unchanged from previous universal charter – mobile temple, revenue splits, portable kit, full-moon amendments, etc.)

Sealed this 28th day of November, 2025
